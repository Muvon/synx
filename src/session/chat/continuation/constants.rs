pub const SUMMARY_REQUEST_PROMPT: &str = r#"
CRITICAL: Session approaching token limits. Provide COMPREHENSIVE handoff summary to continue work seamlessly from scratch:

## MAIN OBJECTIVE & SCOPE
What we're building/fixing/implementing:
- Primary goal and why it matters
- Scope boundaries and what's included/excluded
- Success criteria and expected outcomes

## DETAILED PROGRESS ACCOMPLISHED
Complete breakdown of what's been done:
- Specific code changes made (functions, files, logic)
- Configuration changes and settings modified
- Tools executed and their results/outputs
- Problems identified and solutions implemented
- Key insights discovered during implementation
- Any debugging steps taken and findings

## CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATE
Exact technical situation right now:
- What's working vs what's broken/incomplete
- Active work in progress (half-finished implementations)
- Current file states and modifications pending
- Any compilation/runtime issues encountered
- Dependencies or prerequisites that are ready/missing

## REQUIRED FILE CONTEXTS
CRITICAL: List ALL files needed as context using the EXACT format below. These will be automatically expanded to full file content.

**MANDATORY FORMAT - Use context tags with file references:**
<context>
filename:startline:endline
filename:startline:endline
filename:startline:endline
</context>

**PARSING REQUIREMENTS:**
- Each line inside <context> tags must be exactly: filepath:number:number
- No spaces around colons
- Use absolute paths from project root (src/main.rs not ./src/main.rs)
- Line numbers must be positive integers
- Start line must be ≤ end line
- End line must be ≤ 10000
- Maximum 10 file ranges total

**INCLUDE THESE FILES:**
- Core implementation files with key functions/classes
- Configuration files with relevant sections
- Test files if testing is involved
- Any modified or newly created files
- Files containing error patterns or debugging areas

**EXAMPLE CORRECT FORMAT:**
<context>
src/session/chat/session_continuation.rs:100:200
src/config/mod.rs:50:100
tests/integration_test.rs:1:50
</context>

**WRONG FORMATS (will not be parsed):**
- Missing <context> tags
- src/main.rs : 1 : 50 (spaces around colons)
- ./src/main.rs:1:50 (relative path with ./)
- src/main.rs lines 1-50 (text description)
- src/main.rs:1:50, src/lib.rs:1:100 (comma separated on same line)

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
Specific actionable steps to continue (in order):
- Exact next implementation tasks
- Files to modify and what changes to make
- Commands to run or tools to execute
- Testing or verification steps needed
- Expected challenges and how to handle them

## CRITICAL TECHNICAL DETAILS
Essential information for seamless continuation:
- Important variable names, function signatures, or data structures
- Key algorithms or logic patterns being used
- Error handling approaches or edge cases discovered
- Performance considerations or constraints
- Integration points with existing systems
- Any architectural decisions made and why

## CONTEXT FOR UNDERSTANDING
Background information needed to work effectively:
- How this work fits into the larger system
- Related components or dependencies involved
- Previous attempts or approaches that didn't work
- Domain knowledge or business logic relevant
- Any user requirements or constraints to remember

PROVIDE COMPLETE DETAILS - imagine explaining to a new developer who needs to pick up exactly where you left off.

pub const CONTINUATION_USER_MESSAGE_TEMPLATE: &str = r#"Thank you for the summary.

Currently we are working on the following requests:
<tasks>
{}
</tasks>

Here's the required file context:
<files>
{}
</files>

---

Let's continue our work from where we left off.

You can use use plan tool to get list of tasks we are working in if any.

Please proceed with the next steps as outlined in your summary.

CRITICAL: use tool calling in parallel when its possible to reach results faster and more efficiently. Always PLAN your edits in advance and act with parallel tools execution."#;
