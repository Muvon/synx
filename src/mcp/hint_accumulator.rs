// Hint accumulator — collects tool-misuse hints during a tool execution round.
//
// Tools call push_hint() instead of appending ⚠️ text to their result content.
// After all parallel tool results are collected, the session layer calls drain_hints()
// and injects a single user-role message so the AI sees the guidance without
// polluting individual tool result strings.
//
// Thread-local storage is correct here: each tokio::spawn task gets its own
// OS thread (or is pinned to one), so hints from concurrent tool calls accumulate
// independently and are drained by the coordinating task after join_all().
// The drain happens in the same task that spawned the tool tasks, which runs on
// the coordinator thread — so we use a Mutex-protected global instead to safely
// collect across spawn boundaries.
