# Octomind Overview

## What is Octomind?

Octomind is a session-based AI development assistant written in Rust that helps developers understand and work with their codebase through natural conversation. Built with a simplified, session-first approach, it provides intelligent code assistance through built-in tools for file operations, code analysis, and development tasks.

## Simplified Architecture

Octomind has been redesigned around a core principle: **everything happens within interactive AI sessions**. Gone are the separate command-line tools for indexing and searching. Instead, all functionality is accessible through natural conversation with AI assistants that have built-in development tools.

### Session-First Design

    A[User] --> B[Interactive Session]

    B --> D[MCP Tools]
    B --> E[AI Provider]

    C --> F[Developer Role<br/>Full Tools]
    C --> G[Assistant Role<br/>No Tools]
    C --> H[Custom Role<br/>Configurable]

    D --> I[File Operations]
    D --> J[Code Analysis]
    D --> K[Shell Commands]
    D --> L[External Tools]

    E --> M[Multiple AI Providers<br/>OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.]
```

## Core Components

### 1. Session Management
- **Interactive conversations** with AI assistants
- **Session persistence** - save, resume, and organize conversations
- **Role-based configuration** - different behavior for different use cases
- **Context management** - automatic optimization and token management

### 2. MCP Tool Integration
Development tools are provided through the MCP (Model-Centric Programming) protocol:
- **File Operations**: Read, write, edit files with AI assistance
- **Code Analysis**: Understand code structure and relationships
- **Shell Commands**: Execute development commands when needed
- **External Tools**: Integrate with external MCP servers

### 3. Role-Based Configuration
- **Developer Role**: Full development environment with all tools enabled
- **Assistant Role**: Simple conversation mode without development tools
- **Custom Roles**: User-defined roles with specific tool configurations

### 4. AI Provider Support
Extensive support for multiple AI providers with unified interface:
- OpenRouter (multi-provider access)
- OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Vertex AI
- Amazon Bedrock, Cloudflare Workers AI

### 5. Layered Architecture
For complex development tasks, an optional multi-stage processing system:
- **Query Processor**: Improves and clarifies user requests
- **Context Generator**: Gathers necessary code context using tools
- **Developer**: Implements solutions and produces responses

**Context Management**: Use `/done` to finalize tasks with comprehensive summarization.

## Key Features

### 1. Natural Conversation Interface
Instead of complex command-line options, simply talk to Octomind:
- **"How does authentication work in this project?"**
- **"Show me the main configuration files"**
- **"Help me fix this compilation error"**
- **"Add error handling to the login function"**

### 2. Intelligent Project Understanding
Sessions automatically analyze your project context:
- **Project structure** and organization
- **Code relationships** and dependencies
- **Configuration files** and settings
- **Documentation** and README files

### 3. Built-in Development Tools
All tools are accessible through natural conversation:
- **File operations**: View, edit, create files
- **Code analysis**: Understand structure and relationships
- **Shell commands**: Execute development tasks
- **Search capabilities**: Find code by meaning

### 4. Flexible Role System
Choose the right mode for your needs:
- **Developer Role**: Full development environment
- **Assistant Role**: Simple chat without tools
- **Custom Roles**: Define your own specialized configurations

### 5. Session Management
Organize your development conversations:
- **Save and resume** development sessions
- **Context optimization** for long conversations
- **Token management** and cost tracking
- **Session switching** for different projects

## How to Use Octomind

### Basic Workflow

1. **Start a session**: `octomind session`
2. **Ask questions**: Natural language about your code
3. **Get assistance**: AI helps with analysis and modifications
4. **Continue working**: Session maintains context and history

### Example Interactions

```
> How is user authentication implemented?

[AI analyzes project structure, finds auth-related files, explains the implementation]

> Can you add rate limiting to the login endpoint?

[AI examines the login code, implements rate limiting, shows the changes]

> Why is the build failing?

[AI checks build errors, analyzes the code, suggests fixes]
```

## Getting Started

### Quick Setup

1. **Install Octomind** - See [Installation Guide](./01-installation.md) for detailed instructions
2. **Configure AI Provider** - See [Provider Setup](./03-providers.md) for comprehensive setup
3. **Start Your First Session**
  ```bash
  # Start in your project directory
  cd your_project
  octomind session
  ```

### What's Different

Octomind now uses a simplified, session-first approach:

```bash
# Everything in one place
octomind session

# Then just ask naturally:
> "How does auth work in this project?"
> "Add error handling to login"
> "Why is the build failing?"
```

No separate indexing or search commands needed.
